# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains Python and C++ code that may be useful in competitive programming problems (e.g. from HackerRank and LeetCode).
Some of the files are coded for fun/practice while others exist to fill a hole in the given language's standard library.

For example, UnionFind is a useful data structure to track equivalence classes in the integers and comes up quite a lot, but I am not aware of any built in versions of it in CPython.

I plan to add to this repository in the future.

## Contents

1 - Several graph related algorithms.

2 - UnionFind data structure.

3 - Trie data structure.
